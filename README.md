## **Bioinformatics Data Analysis with RapidMiner**

### **Project Overview:**
This project aims to predict the outcome of hepatitis patients based on their symptoms using bioinformatics data analysis techniques. The dataset used in this project is obtained from the UCI machine learning repository and contains information about patients who either survived or died from hepatitis.

### **Learning Outcomes:**
1. **Acquiring Hands-on Experience with RapidMiner:** Utilize RapidMiner, a leading analytics platform, to perform data cleaning, model building, and evaluation tasks.
2. **Building a Full Data Analytics Pipeline:** Construct a comprehensive data analytics pipeline encompassing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation stages.
3. **Practicing Data Classification using Naïve Bayes:** Implement the Naïve Bayes algorithm for predictive modeling to classify patients into survival or death outcomes.
4. **Understanding Model Evaluations:** Gain insights into model evaluation techniques such as cross-validation and split validation to assess the performance of the predictive model.
5. **Experiencing Impact of Handling Missing Values:** Explore the effects of different strategies for handling missing values on predictive modeling accuracy.

### **Project Structure:**
1. **Introduction:** Provides an overview of the project's purpose, dataset, and tools used.
2. **Preparing the Data:** Instructions on downloading the dataset, preprocessing steps (e.g., replacing missing values), and importing data into RapidMiner.
3. **Designing the Analytics Pipeline:** Step-by-step guide on building the analytics pipeline using RapidMiner's Design perspective, including creating folders, importing data, and setting attribute roles.
4. **Designing the Validator and Missing Values Replacement Process:** Detailed instructions on setting up cross-validation and replacing missing values using RapidMiner operators.
5. **Mini Exercise:** Optional exercise to optimize model parameters using the Optimize Parameters operator with a neural network model.
